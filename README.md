# ASCluaUtils
This is a collection of small utilities made using the gestionFS.c library I created for ASCcrypte.

You can install all of them at once by doing :
``bash
make && sudo make install
```
## makeclean
This software is used to recursively execute the make clean function in a directory.
Usage: `makeclean <directory>`
If no directory is given the current directory will be targeted.
### Installation
Simply do :
```bash
make makeclean && sudo make installmakeclean
```
## texclean
This software is used to clean files created by LaTeX compilation.
Usage: `texclean <option> <directory>`
Available option:
* limited (default) : keep .ps and .pdf
* all : remove all files generated by LaTeX compilation including .ps and .pdf files
* limitedRec : like limited but recursively
* allRec : like all but recursively
### Installation
Simply do :
```bash
make texclean && sudo make installtexclean
```
## grepDIr
This software is used to search a regular expression in all the file of a directory and print them nicely.
Usage : `grepDir [expression] <option> <directory>`
If no directory is given the search will be made in the curent directory.
