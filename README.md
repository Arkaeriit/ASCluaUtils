# ASCluaUtils
This is a collection of small utilities made using the gestionFS.c library I created for ASCcrypte.

## Instalation
To install this suite of utilities you need the library ASCgestionFS, available here: https://github.com/Arkaeriit/ASCgestionFS.

When the library is installed, this just use: 
```bash
make && sudo make install
```
This will install all the utilities at once. If you are only interested by one, reffer to the following sections.
